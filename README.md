# Lessons Learnt

While building this project, I learned a whole lot of things like:

- useHistory vs useNavigate
I got to learn that useHistory has been replaced with useNavigate in the newest version of React.
- useLocation
- How useEffect can help greatly in managing states and re-rendering as well.
- Functional Components
- How to fetch APIs with React, specifically useEffect!

It was great building this project because it has opened my eyes to many new things because every step of the application of my thoughts and processes, wanting to do more, has helped me learn many new concepts!
